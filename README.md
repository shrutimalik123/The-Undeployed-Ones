# The Undeployed Ones

A curated collection of innovative projects by **Shruti Malik** that are currently undeployed due to API key requirements.

## 🚀 How to Run These Projects

Since these applications rely on paid or private API keys (such as Google Gemini, OpenAI, etc.), they are not hosted live. However, you can easily run them locally!

### Steps:
1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button on the project's GitHub page.
2. **Clone Locally**: Clone your forked repository to your machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
   ```
3. **Get an API Key**: Sign up for the required service (e.g., Google AI Studio) and generate an API key.
4. **Configure Environment**: Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your key.
   ```env
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
5. **Run the App**: Follow the installation instructions in the project's README to install dependencies and start the server.
